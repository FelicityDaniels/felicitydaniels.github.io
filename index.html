                    <p>My time as an undergraduate has been filled with many challenges and just as much growth. Upon beginning college, I could not have predicted the directions that I took, but I would not change anything about it. I became a more independent, entrepreneurial, and socially aware person, and I developed skills such as problem solving, team work, management, technical design, and communication.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">The skills I have developed the most while pursuing my bachelor’s have been problem solving and self-teaching. When I first started college, I had mostly relied on teachers to give me solution methods that I simply memorized and implemented. Because of this, my college courses challenged me in ways I didn’t expect, but I welcomed the change. As I engaged more with material, I gained a better understanding of what topics I like best, and I decided to work on research and engineering projects. The first project, a collegiate rocket launch competition, presented me with a fun challenge. We needed to create a high-powered rocket that would safely launch to a specific height, and deploy a ground excursion unit that could move independently along the ground as far as possible within a given time frame. I knew almost nothing but some math and basic physics, and I had never worked in a group for anything but small class projects, but by the launch day several months later, I had familiarized myself with various facets of rocketry and engineering without the structured guidance of a classroom, and my team had created a rocket that was successful on launch day.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I enjoyed my first extracurricular college experience, the collegiate rocket launch competition, so much that I decided that I wanted to try managing all or part of one. Pursuing this, I discovered RockSat and MPG-PROTO, and decided that those were even better options. The RockSat project that I managed was part of a program provided by the Colorado Space Grant Consortium so students can build and design a rocket payload to be launched on a sounding rocket. MPG-PROTO is the next iteration of the fuel gauging research being done for spacecraft that students at Carthage have been working on for several years.  These projects take a little more planning and effort than the rocket launch competition, though. At first, I had no clue what I was doing.  I went to different professors and students who had worked on similar projects in the past, and created dialogue that helped my colleagues and I make timely progress. I had never scheduled anything but small things for myself, and never more than a few days in advance. As I worked, I learned that not only do I like technical problem solving, but taking the time to understand and navigate each of my peers, all of the parts of the projects, and their relationships was engaging and fun. Identifying each person’s strengths, weaknesses, interests, and communication styles became an important task of mine for the sake of my teammates and the projects. <p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Now that I have spent quite a bit of time on these projects, I’m familiar with CAD modeling, I’ve used it to design propellant management devices for a project titled Modal Propellant Gauging - Propellant Refueling and on Orbit Transfer Operations (MPG-PROTO) and another iteration of the experiment that will be tested on the International Space Station (ISS). I have also used it to 3D print and mill a number of parts used for RockSat-C and MPG-PROTO. I’ve also gotten comfortable with the engineering design process, from identifying a need, to the design process, all the way through assembly and testing; all while meeting success criteria as the projects were iteratively reviewed.<p>
                    <p class="mb-0">Alongside all of these projects over the last few years, I decided to try something outside of my academic comfort zone - freelance illustration. At first, the only way I could get my artwork out was by giving it away for free. Nobody expressed any interest in buying it. Frustrated but undeterred, I decided to look to other, established artists and find the patterns I saw in their success. Over the course of about a year, I learned more about marketing, how to best invest in each of my interactions with others, and garnering attention through social media than I ever could have imagined.  By the end of that year, I was regularly selling my work. I had developed a working method for success completely independently, and in an area that I had no prior experience.<p>
                    <p class="mb-0">These last few years have highlighted the joy and challenge of seriously and independently learning, and how fun it is to get to apply my knowledge creatively. My time as an undergraduate has also taught me how to better work with others and manage longer-term projects. I’m aiming to expand on all of these skills and develop more in my work as I step forward out of my undergraduate studies. All of this has enriched my life both professionally and personally, and I have no inclination to stop expanding that. <p>

                    <p>The Modal Propellant Gauging - PropellantRefueling and on Orbit Transfer Operations (MPG-PROTO) project implements a Propellant Management Device (PMD) that guides spacecraft fuel away from the system’s vent port, preventing erosion of the Lunar Gateway Project. I worked as a subsystem lead, designing, assembling, and testing all or some parts of the “flow loop” system, including the propellant management device for the secondary tank. I used CAD modeling for the design. In this role, much time was spent communicating about other subsystems in order to interface with the other elements, and many design changes were made to suit the needs of the project as it evolved.</p>

                    <p>There are very few commercial software packages that have been validated for use in low gravity to predict the behavior of liquids and other fluids. RockSat-C is an opportunity to devise a simple 2D experiment in order to test the predictions of these computational fluid dynamics software packages. I worked as the project leader and systems engineer, designing, assembling, and testing many of the project components and supervising all of the others. Working with my teammates, we prepared for and passed a number of design and testing reviews to be ready to survive the launch conditions at the NASA Wallops flight facility. I implemented AGILE management and planning techniques, and spent a lot of time communicating with my peers so they better understood the context of their roles and the needs of the project.</p>
